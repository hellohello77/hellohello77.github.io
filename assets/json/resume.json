My primary focus lies in reinforcement learning and computer vision, demonstrated through my research paper, Action-Constrained Imitation Learning. My technical expertise is further highlighted in projects like 3D Reconstruction from Road Markers, where I inferred the speed of a self-driving car. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong leadership experience, enabling me to lead effectively while thriving as a collaborative team player in any work environment."},"publications":[{"name":"Action-Constrained Imitation Learning","publisher":"International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)","releaseDate":"2024-10-02","url":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=UlAkM88Vum"}],"awards":[{"awarder":"2017 World Mathematics Invitational (WMI) Finals","date":"2017-07-17","title":"Gold Medal","url":"https://www.wminv.org/"}],"work":[{"name":"Trend Micro","position":"Software R&D Intern-Data Analytics","startDate":"2023-07-03","endDate":"2023-08-31","summary":"Utilized various machine learning techniques for data analysis and employed effective storytelling strategies, driving a 63% revenue increase for a new product.","highlights":["Unsupervised Learning","SQL","Google BigQuery"]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","location":"IL, U.S.","url":"https://illinois.edu/","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"M.S.","startDate":"2024-08-26","endDate":"2025-12-19","score":"10","courses":["Machine Learning for Signal Processing","Algorithms","Numerical Analysis"]},{"institution":"National Taiwan University","location":"Taipei, Taiwan","url":"https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/","area":"Electrical Engineering","studyType":"B.S.","startDate":"2019-09-01","endDate":"2024-01-10","score":"10","courses":["Machine Learning","Deep Learning for Computer Vision","Computer Vision: from recognition to geometry","Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Medicine","Linear Algebra","Data Structure","Convex Optimization","Introduction to the Internet of Things","Computer Architecture","Web Programming"]}],"certificates":[{"name":"Machine Learning","date":"2021-08-20","issuer":"MLSS 2021","url":"assets/pdf/CV.pdf","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"People's Climate March","location":"Zurich, Switzerland","position":"Lead Organizer","url":"https://example.com","startDate":"2014-04-01","endDate":"2015-07-01","summary":"Lead organizer for the New York City branch of the People's Climate March, the largest climate march in history.","highlights":["Awarded 'Climate Hero' award by Greenpeace for my efforts organizing the march.","Men of the year 2014 by Time magazine"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Mandarin","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}]}
